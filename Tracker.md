- Spent more time reading through k6 documentation and trying out different scripts to see how they interacted with the greenstand wallet api.  Working through building a script outside of the postman to k6 yaml conversion.  
- Spent a few hours working on visulization of the data generated by k6.  Was able to hook up influxdb to grafana as a way to see the data.  Also connected to k6 cloud to see the test real time, problem is I only have 50 tests before I have to pay for the monthly version of k6 cloud.  RIght now running influxdb with grafana is the way to go.  

To Do for the k6 testing
- Figure out the endpoints better, build the tests smaller (focus on one endpoint versus the entire api)
- Spend a little time configuring the grafana dashboard to provide meaningful results...imported a dashboard just to get up and running and half the results are null.
- Write up a step by step to initialize the k6 test.

- Implementing k6.io performance tests on treetracker api(smaller less code than wallet api).  starting with basic provided scripts to understand the process and how the api works.  Once fine tuned, swapping over to wallet api to try out on the dev environment.
- Ended up running into issues attempting to run tests locally.  Found I can use postman to run k6 test via the test server.  Although not as customizable, I was pretty impressed with what it can do...Out put of the detailed report was upwards of 50k lines.  The summary is more managable, probably all that is needed unless chasing down an issue with performance.
- Started working on basic notes for k6...[K6 Gist](https://gist.github.com/mdcoxe/0d1e208238689ee90c71cfaec108fe6d)
